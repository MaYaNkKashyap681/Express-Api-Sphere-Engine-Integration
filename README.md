# Project Name



## Overview

- Role-based authentication system for admin and participants.
    - Create a signup() feature :
        - Input: name, email, password, role
        - Encrypt passwords using any package supporting hash functions.
        - Store users in any NoSQL database (preferably MongoDB or AWS Dynamo DB).
        - Create a JWT-based access token (1-day expiry).
        - Output : email , accesstoken
    - Create a login() feature :
        - Input: email, password
        - Verify email & password from DB and return appropriate response if mismatch.
        - Output : email , accesstoken
- Create a middleware to differentiate admins from participants.
- A set of APIs for the admin to add, edit or delete the question. Create a Questions table in the DB.
- A set of APIs for the admin to add test cases to a question.
- An API that takes the solution from the user for a particular question. The functionality of that API should be
    - Check if the solution provided is correct or not using Sphere Engine API and the response should also contain the error if it's wrong.
    - Show the response (error/wrong/success) of the solution
    - No need to save the solution in DB.
